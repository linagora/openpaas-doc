## Overview

In OpenPaas, the notion of a mailbox and a folder is the same.

As a user, I can share my mailbox/folder with other users. When sharing a folder with another user, I have the choice 
currently between two sets of permissions:

* `read and update messages` the user can view the folder, as well as read, forward and reply to messages. He can also mark the message as read/unread, as well as star/unstar it.
* `Consultation and organize folder` same as above + delete a message (move to trash), move a message to another shared folder, move to spam.

A user can see all his shared folders in Shared folders tab in Configuration in OpenPaas.

An admin can decide to enable or disable the folder/mailbox sharing for users from the admin panel.
