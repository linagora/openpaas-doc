## Overview

The contact module brings powerful and realtime contact support into the OpenPaaS platform.
It is composed of several components:

- A frontend component. Built using Angular.
- A backend component which can be split into two parts:
  - A DAV compliant backend built on top of [Sabre](http://sabre.io/)
  - A specific backend, built using Node.js, which mainly listen to specific technical events and so provides realtime support and data indexing.

## Install

### OpenPaaS Module

The contact module is provided in the [OpenPaaS modules directory](https://github.com/linagora/openpaas-esn/tree/master/modules/linagora.esn.contact) and enabled by default.

### Sabre Server

The calendar module needs a Sabre server to run. Thanks to its plugin system, the default Sabre distribution has been extended to provide more advanced features. Installation instructions can be found in the [esn-sabre repository](https://github.com/linagora/esn-sabre/blob/master/README.md).
